				<h3>Roger Iyengar</h3>
				<p class="lead">Activities</p>
				<p>Events are a huge part of the ACM. As Events Coordinator, my goal is to ensure that all events are both fun and educational for as many members as possible. I plan to maximize the benefit of attending ACM events by making sure they are run well. I will also put effort into scheduling and getting the word out about our events, so that attendance will be as high as possible.</p>
